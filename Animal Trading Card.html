      <p id="summary">The average male lion weighs around 180 kg (400 lb) while the average female lion weighs around 130 kg (290 lb).

The heaviest lion on record weighed an amazing 375 kg (826 lb).

Lions can reach speeds of up to 81 kph (50 mph) but only in short bursts because of a lack of stamina.

The roar of a lion can be heard from 8 kilometers (5.0 miles) away.

Most lions found in the wild live in southern and eastern parts of Africa.

Lions are very social compared to other cat species, often living in prides that feature females, offspring and a few adult males.

Male lions are easy to recognize thanks to their distinctive manes. Males with darker manes are more likely to attract female lions (lionesses).
